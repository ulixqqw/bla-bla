                    <h3> Meteora</h3>
                    <p> rocks consisting of a mixture of sandstone and clastic rock and reaching a <br>
                        height of 600 m above sea level, in the mountains of Thessaly in northern Greece, 
                        in the north of the peripheral unit of Trikala of the periphery of Thessaly, 1-2 km north of the city of Kalambaka. <br>
                        In 1988, the monasteries located on the tops of the cliffs were included in the list of World Heritage Sites. <br>
                        The rocks were formed more than 60 million years ago and were the rocky bottom of a <br>
                        prehistoric sea that was located on the site of a plain. <br>

                        In total, throughout history, according to various sources,<br>
                        there were 22 or 24 monasteries, along with many single cells, ascitiriums, chapels, hermitages, <br>
                        caves, gates, pillars, scattered throughout the Meteor mountains.

                    <h3>  </h3>
                    <p> The waterfall was discovered by French colonists in the 17th century, <br>
                         but for many years after that it remained almost unknown to the general public. <br>
                         The first European settlements appeared here after the declaration of US independence, when roads began to be built, <br>
                          and the concept of “frontier” acquired a new meaning. As a result of the Anglo-American War of 1812-1815, <br>
                          part of the waterfall ended up on the side of the United States, and the other part on the side of the British loyalists, <br>
                           from whose descendants the state of Canada was subsequently formed. </p>

                    <h3> Lego Black Panther</h3>
                    <p> Based on the film Civil War, the Black Panther wears a black suit with triangular vibranium <br>
                        inserts and a claw necklace around his neck. The mask has shiny <br>
                        ilver outlines and a pair of yellow <br>
                        lenses; the contours continue on a separate piece with short ears. The updated suit from the
                        solo film <br>
                        reduced the presence of metal in favor of muscle-like contours, and replaced the lenses with
                        holes to reveal dark skin <br>
                        and eyes. The Kinetic Energy Suit added blue (later changed to purple) coloring throughout.</p>
